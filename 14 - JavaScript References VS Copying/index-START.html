    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //100 200
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //200 100
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    console.log(players);
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "L"; 
    //team is not an array
    //team is just a REFERENCE to ORIGINAL array
    console.log(team); //["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "L"]
    console.log(players); //["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "L"]
    // therefore the ORIGINAL is updated.

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players[3] = "K";
    //players ==> ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "K"]
    //teams ==> ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "K"]

    // PROBLEM: original array is also changed. 
    // That is an array reference, not an array copy. Both point to the same array!

    // SOLUTION: Take a copy instead 
      // method 1:
      const team2 = players.slice(); //if no arguments passed, returns entire array.
      console.log(team2);
    // method 2:
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team4[2] = "Nobu";
      
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(captain); //{name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99}
    // the original object is also updated. 
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign()
    // Object.assign({})
    // SYNTAX: 
    // Object.assign({}, source, properties to overwrite)
    //start with blank object, object in which to copy properties from, properties to overwrite
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain2 = {...person};
    console.log(captain2);
    console.log(person);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
